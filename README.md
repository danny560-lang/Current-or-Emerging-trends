What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, industry, scientific, and social contexts. 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I believe one of the major challenges of being a computer scientists is tryign to find a problem or define what the problem is. Meaning identifying what the problem is and how it is suppose to be addressesed. So to approach a problem firstly, i would identify the problem and understand what the problem is. Secdonly i think about possible solutons or approaches to solving the problem using my resources, then i will implement my soultion and test it to see if i solves the problem.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My responsiblity is to be trustworthy to clients and make sure i keep their data secure and not leak clients infomation. I believe being trustworthy is the biggest responsibility as a computer scientist.
