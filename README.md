# Current-or-Emerging-trends

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

TreasureHuntGame is a pathfinding AI project. It is a game where the player needs to find the treasure before the AI pirate agent does. Using a deep Q-learning algorithm, the pirate learns the optimal way to find the treasure from any position on the map.

The algorithm used achieves a 90.5% win rate against the given player in less than 7 minutes. The pirate agent starts out with no knowledge of the environment and within the first 20 games learns how to win, consistently beating the player for the following 180 games.
I developed the code that encompasses the reinforcement learning algorithm. I wrote the game loops that utilize Keras and Tensorflow to achieve the pathfinding solution. I was given the game setup code that includes GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, industry, scientific, and social contexts. 
How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I believe one of the major challenges of being a computer scientists is tryign to find a problem or define what the problem is. Meaning identifying what the problem is and how it is suppose to be addressesed. So to approach a problem firstly, i would identify the problem and understand what the problem is. Secdonly i think about possible solutons or approaches to solving the problem using my resources, then i will implement my soultion and test it to see if i solves the problem.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My responsiblity is to be trustworthy to clients and make sure i keep their data secure and not leak clients infomation. I believe being trustworthy is the biggest responsibility as a computer scientist.
